My own sources following the [tutorial from jayway](https://github.com/jayway/vue-js-workshop)

Issues: 
- Bootstrap 4 alpha 6, not beta (navbar failure)
- Bootstrap 4 require popper.js
- Bootstrap 4 import sass todo

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

# Jayway Vue.js 2.0 workshop

This is a visual Vue.js 2.0 workshop where you will be building an e-commerce application (Jaystore). Hopefully this workshop will give you a feel for how you can use different techniques depending on the size of your application and how to handle different challenges when a Vue.js 2.0 app evolves in size and complexity.
